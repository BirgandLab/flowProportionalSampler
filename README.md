flowProportionalSampler
=======================

relying on external data from a flow meter, this project pumps water into a composite sample at regular time, or flow thresholds. The system uses the Arduino MEGA as a base, interfaces with a Sontek flow probe, and controls a bunch of valves and a pump. It is intended to function with a uv-vis spectrometer and water quality probe, however it can be used as a standalone sampler.
