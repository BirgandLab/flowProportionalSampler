//This settings file is used to change fundamental parameters used in the Flow proportional sampler routing
//It tolerates comments and whitespace.
//HOWEVER: the variable names cannot be changed here unless they are also changed in the program itself
//		   similarly, variables that are not mentioned or used in the main program will not be used
//		   when this file is read in, it will match internal variables with the ones in this file, if it cannot match
//		   based on misspellings etc, the variable will remain undefined. This will be bad.
